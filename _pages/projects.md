Machine Learning:

- [Schrodinger Solver using Fully Connected Neural Network(FCNN)][Schrodinger-Solver-using-FCNN] - This project uses a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) implemented in PyTorch to predict the ground state wavefunction of the 1D Schrodinger equation based on the potential.

- [Lorenz System LSTM predictor][Lorenz_LSTM_prediction] - This project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to predict the behavior of the Lorenz system, a classic example of chaos theory. The model learns to predict future states of the system given a sequence of past states, demonstrating how deep learning can capture chaotic dynamics.
